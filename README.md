This repository includes the code and dataset used in the paper, "Federated Artificial Resampling for Imbalanced Facial Emotion Recognition", by Kushankur Ghosh ,  Colin Bellinger,  Roberto Corizzo,  Paula Branco,  Bartosz Krawczyk and Nathalie Japkowicz published in IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing.

The main objective of this paper is to propose a federated learning-based facial emotion recognition framework by mitigating class imbalance on the client models, while ensuring data privacy and preventing adversarial attacks from biased client data.
