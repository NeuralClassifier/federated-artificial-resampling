This repository includes the code and dataset used in the paper, "Federated Artificial Resampling for Imbalanced Facial Emotion Recognition", by Sankhadeep Chatterjee,  Kushankur Ghosh,  Saranya Bhattacharjee,  Asit Kumar Das, and Soumen Banerjee published in IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing.

The main objective of this paper is to propose a federated learning-based facial emotion recognition framework by mitigating class imbalance on the client models, while ensuring data privacy and preventing adversarial attacks from biased client data.
